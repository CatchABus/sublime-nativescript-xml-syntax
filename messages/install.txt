============================================================
Thank you for installing {N}ativeScript Core XML Syntax
============================================================

This package adds syntax highlighting for XML files used by NativeScript Core flavor.
See: https://docs.nativescript.org/tutorial/plain.html#getting-started-with-nativescript

Syntax is identical to the default one for XML with the addition of highlighting view model bindings.  
The highlight color is the one used for CDATA tags.
