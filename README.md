## NativeScript Core XML Syntax

This package adds syntax highlighting for [NativeScript Core](https://docs.nativescript.org/tutorial/plain.html#getting-started-with-nativescript) XML files.

Syntax is identical to the default one for XML with the addition of highlighting view model bindings.  
The highlight color is the one used for CDATA tags.
